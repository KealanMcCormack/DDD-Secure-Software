###Kealan McCormack
My contributions to the project was the user login page, all pages associated with the forum, the statistics page, did work on the 
homepage and new user login page. I also created database repositories and model objects that are tied to the functionality of these pages. 
I did work on validation of input and flow of the backend functions in MainController.  



###Lukasz Filanowski
As part of this software project I worked on the account registration page, worked on the main homepage for the user, 
homepage for the admin, login page for the admin, new HSE user registration page
and last activity page. Any accompanying databases and model classes were also created by me. Likewise, any methods in the MainController
that ensure the backend for the pages functions were made by me.
